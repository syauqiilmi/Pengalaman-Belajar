# Java Tutorial For Beginners

Welcome to this book on **"Learning Java In 150 Steps"**.

I am **Syauqi Madinatul Ilmi**, and I have more than two decades of programming experience.

I love Programming. One of the aims I had when I started in28minutes was to make learning programming easy. Thanks for helping us provide amazing courses to 300,000 learners across the world.

At **In28Minutes**, we ask ourselves one question every day: "How do we create awesome learning experiences?"

In this book, you will learn to write **object** **oriented** code with Java. You will be exposed to a lot of examples, exercises and tips. We will take up a lot of examples, and try and see how to write code for those in Java.
